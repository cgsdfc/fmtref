abstract = {Multi-view learning is an emerging direction in machine learning which considers learning with multiple views to improve the generalization performance. Multi-view learning is also known as data fusion or data integration from multiple feature sets. Since the last survey of multi-view machine learning in early 2013, multi-view learning has made great progress and developments in recent years, and is facing new challenges. This overview first reviews theoretical underpinnings to understand the properties and behaviors of multi-view learning. Then multi-view learning methods are described in terms of three classes to offer a neat categorization and organization. For each category, representative algorithms and newly proposed algorithms are presented. The main feature of this survey is that we provide comprehensive introduction for the recent developments of multi-view learning methods on the basis of coherence with early methods. We also attempt to identify promising venues and point out some specific challenges which can hopefully promote further research in this rapidly developing field.}

abstract = {Practically, we often face the dilemma that some of the examples for training a classifier are incorrectly labeled due to various subjective and objective factors. Although intensive efforts have been put to design classifiers that are robust to label noise, most of the previous methods have not fully utilized data distribution information. To address this issue, this paper introduces a bi-level learning paradigm termed “Spectral Cluster Discovery” (SCD) for combating with noisy labels. Namely, we simultaneously learn a robust classifier (Learning stage) by discovering the low-rank approximation to the ground-truth label matrix and learn an ideal affinity graph (Clustering stage). Specifically, we use the learned classifier to assign the examples with similar label to a mutual cluster. Based on the cluster membership, we use the learned affinity graph to explore the noisy examples based on the cluster membership. Both stages will reinforce each other iteratively. Experimental results on typical benchmark and real-world datasets verify the superiority of SCD to other label noise learning methods.},

abstract = {Kuhn-Munkres algorithm is one of the most popular polynomial time algorithms for solving clas- sical assignment problem. The assignment problem is to find an assignment of the jobs to the workers that has minimum cost, given a cost matrix X ∈ Rm×n, where the element in the i-th row and j-th column represents the cost of assigning the i-th job to the j-th worker. The time complexity of Kuhn-Munkres algorithm is O(mn^2), which brings prohibitive computational burden on large scale matrices, limiting the further usage of these methods in real applications. Motivated by this observation, a series of acceleration skills and parallel techniques have been studied on special structure. In this paper, we improve the original Kuhn-Munkres algorithm by utilizing the sparsity structure of the cost matrix, and propose two algorithms, sparsity based KM(sKM) and parallel KM(pKM). Furthermore, numerical experiments are given to show the efficiency of our algorithm. We empirically evaluate the proposed algorithm sKM) and (pKM) on random generated large scale datasets. Results have shown that sKM) greatly improves the computational performance. At the same time, (pKM) provides a parallel way to solve assignment problem with considerable accuracy loss.},
